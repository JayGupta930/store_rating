# 🏬 Store Rating Platform

A full-stack web application built with **React.js** and **Supabase** that allows users to register, log in, and rate stores. The platform supports three roles:

- **Admin** – Manage users and stores (For admin you can use this email and pass jay.gupta@gmail.com Jay123)
- **Normal User** – Rate and view stores (You can just sign up and logged in )
- **Store Owner** – View ratings and feedback (same as normal user)
